### Part 1: Unfair Comparisons: How Visualizing Social Inequality Can Make It Worse

This was a really insightful article revealing how even neutral, accurate, and well-intentioned visualizations can be negatively or harmfully interpreted, particularly in perpetuating stereotypes and pre-conceived notions about certain ideas and people. The article also discussed how variability is an important factor to include in visualizations, as means and medians can be misleading alone. 

I agree that due to human biases, a well-intentioned neutral figure can never be truly neutral. My first thought at a solution was to create a figure that is explicit in its narrative and leaves little room for inference/interpretation. This ensures that no matter who is looking at the visualization, they can extract the same takeaway. However, this is problematic because even the author of the visualization has their own biases, in the types of charts they choose, the selection, scale, variables of the data they choose to highlight. Data is constantly being manipulated and misused to support false narratives (even in heavily cited papers and well accredited journals). It’s important to display data in an ethical way (using variance is one way to help do that).

Bias is inevitable so the question really becomes should we saturate figures with a narrative to avoid interpretative bias or create a neutral and accurate figure and allow for interpretation? I personally don’t know the answer to this question and am curious to hear other people’s thoughts on this.

### Part 2: Useful Junk? The Effects of Visual Embellishment on Comprehension and Memorability of Charts

This article considers the long-standing debate between Tuftian minimalist figures versus visually embellished figures. The article investigated these two different approaches by designing a study that compared interpretation accuracy and long-term recall of the figures. It found that accuracy was the same for both types of figures, but recall and preference towards the embellished figures was a lot higher. The results ask us to question the Tuftian minimalist norm towards data visualization. 

My personal opinion is that good data visualizations should be a mix of Tuftian minimalist approach and attention-grabbing elements. That is, one should avoid including elements that really don’t help to explain the data in a clear or relevant way (eg. extra variables, variables with multiple aesthetics, unnecessary text) but feel free to include elements that do enhance the narrative (eg. specific colors that have certain connotations, using shapes to highlight key trends). I personally don’t think you need graphic images like a monster to create a meaningful and memorable visualization. But I also think the completely minimalist figures are just plain boring and are not going to catch anyone’s attention for more than 3 seconds.
