## Part 1:

This paper suggests that there exist better graphical representations of data compared to the most commonly used graphical representations. Specifically, the study showed that dot charts (with grouping) and framed-rectangle charts may actually be more informative and easily perceived as compared to bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. For example, framed-rectangle charts are a more effective representation of the data compared to statistical maps with shading because maps treat states uniformly, although they rarely are uniform. The maps reduce the accuracy and the information of the figures. Though these examples are outdated, the idea may carry on to modern data visualization. New visualization techniques may be developed to replace the outdated versions, especially as 3d and animation capabilities have come into play. However, that’s not to say that we should replace the current popular data visualizations. There’s a reason those types of plots (eg. scatter and bar charts) are popular — they convey information accurately and are well-understood by the general public. While science of perception may have shifted slightly — in that humans are more sensitive to animation and color compared to when this paper was written — I still think that what makes an effective data visualization is clarity and accuracy, above all.
