# A central issue with this figure in addition to how busy it is
# is that the figure creates this narrative between the relationship of 
# gdp and happiness and doesn't really include any other variables
# people who don't understand statistics will likely come to the conclusion
# that countries are happier due to wealth
# My goal is to reinforce correlation â‰  causation and provide some 
# other variables to support that happiness is related to so many other
# things (eg. level of education)
### https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/table/msch/?levels=1&interpolation=0&extrapolation=0
# I'm not 100% decided on this, but one idea was to make a R shiny 
# app and be able to switch between variables
# OR somehow incorporate a third or fourth variable into this plot 
# I have some really rough sketches but nothing I think that is worth sharing
# at the moment

# Alternatively, I might try to do something with the time variable?
